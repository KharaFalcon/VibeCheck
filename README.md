# VibeCheck

VibeCheck is an innovative browser extension designed to act as your personal communication coach. It analyzes your draft messages and emails in real-time through an "emotional lens," identifying keywords and phrases that might convey an unintended harsh or overly emotional tone.

When emotional language is detected, VibeCheck goes beyond simple alerts. It provides respectful, human-authored alternative phrasings that are carefully crafted to help you express yourself more clearly, constructively, and empathetically. These aren't just generic synonyms; they're reflective rewrites aimed at improving your communication effectiveness.

VibeCheck seamlessly integrates with your favorite email and messaging applications like Gmail and Outlook, offering suggestions precisely where you need them.



## Features

## Technologies Used
VibeCheck leverages a modern web stack to deliver a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience:

**Frontend:**
* **HTML:** For structuring the extension's user interface.
* **CSS:** For styling and visual presentation.
* **JavaScript:** For core logic, real-time analysis, and UI interactivity.

**Backend & Tooling:**
* **Firebase (Cloud Firestore):** For data storage (e.g., user preferences, potentially shared rewrite suggestions if opt-in and anonymized).

## Usage

Once installed, VibeCheck will automatically activate when you are composing messages or emails in supported web applications (e.g., Gmail, Outlook web version). As you type, the extension will provide discreet suggestions directly within your drafting area.

Look for highlighted text or a small indicator near phrases that might be perceived as overly emotional. Clicking on these indicators will reveal alternative, more empathetic phrasings that you can choose to use.
